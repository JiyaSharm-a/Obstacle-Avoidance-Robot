# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot
Here we have created an Autonomous obstacle avoidance robot using ARDUINO.
Designed to navigate through its surroundings, identify obstacles and remove it from the path.
Equipped with Ultrasonic sensors, InfraRed sensors, servo motors to detect obstacles in real time and avoid collisions.
